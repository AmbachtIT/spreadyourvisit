## Spread Your Visit

As the Covid-19 crisis unfolds, we are all looking for ways to constribute. [Social distancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing) is an  important  weapon in the arsenal against the coronavirus. By limiting physical  contact, we limit opportunities for contagion. However, in some cases visiting public places is unavoidable. You might need to buy food at the super market or go to the pharmacy to pick up medication.

During peak hours, it might become very difficult to keep distance, while during quiet hours the super market might be nearly empty. Ideally, all visitors would spread their visits as much as possible to prevent this from happening. But how do you coordinate this?

The answer is: Pick a random time. If everybody would pick a random time to visit a super market, visits would be perfectly spread across the day. 

## Caveats

1. You should always consider if a trip is really necessary. 
2. Always follow instructions from your local authority.
